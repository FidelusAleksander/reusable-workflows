Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- Created a reusable workflow using `workflow_call`
- Called that reusable workflow from a standard CI workflow
- Added permissions-aware deployment and PR feedback jobs to the caller workflow

### What's next?

- Explore [GitHub Skills: Test with Actions](https://github.com/skills/test-with-actions)
- Read [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
- Try extracting a repeated workflow from one of your own repositories
